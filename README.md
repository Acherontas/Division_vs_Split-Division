# Division_vs_Split-Division
the division and the division of the splits and the importance of decimals 

why do we have float decimals a lots of digits that follows the dot or comma
after the main X number of digits in the results
we also have cpu registers 

a little example by using the first 8 or 9 digits in the sections below

        initial result of 2785/33=84.393939 
        2000/33=60.60606 as 60 and 60606
        700/33=21.212121 as 21 and 212121
        80/33=2.4242424 as 2 and 4242424
        5/33=0.1515151 as 0 and 1515151
        results is 84.393938 and 603302
        so we have 84.393939 and 83.393938 xD 

shows that we have a missing 00.000001 lots digits
imagine at bigger sequential numbers the difference.

i will upload an program in C++ doesnt works
very well but some of you can tweak it if you want
just ask me
